# AutismDianosisSystem
This includes data sets, codes, and relative document that describes results from the system. 
For details about motivation, how it was implemented, results, and directory, please, check the report.
Since I was developing two systems, Robot Movement Recognition System, and Autism Dianosis System, there are two contents for each topic in the report. 
They are distinguished by (1)Wall Following Robot data set for Robot Movement Recognition System, and (2)Autism Adult data set for Autism dianosis System.
